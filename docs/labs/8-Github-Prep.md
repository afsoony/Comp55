# Preparation for Git Team Lab

This lab are a mishmash of steps that need to be completed individually
before we meet again in class.  What we are doing is joining the wide world of sharing code repositories.  To do that, we're going learn about git, which is a way being able to keep track of our changes in code, and we're also going to learn about and use github, which is one of the leading companies to hosts git repositories (think projects) online.  *Some of the images that are here are taken directly from or sourced directly from github itself.*

## Signup for a github account

Easiest way to do this is by going here:

**<http://education.github.com/pack>**

If you already have a github account, you can still get the pack (and
you should\!), but you can also just jump to [start github classroom](##start-github-classroom). Some of these
are just awesome technologies that might be of use later when you are
writing programs to take over the world. **One thing you'll need to do for
certain is to [verify your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/verifying-your-email-address).** You can check to see if your
email is verified by checking the Emails tab of your account settings in github.
If you have a warning icon like this picture, then you'll want to ask to resend the verification email and verify your email with them.
![](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/settings/email-verify-button.png)  <br> *Source: github*<br>If you do not have a warning sign or the label does not say *Resend Verification email*, then your email is verified.  The other thing you should do
is give youself an icon picture, which is always fun to do and can be done from the profile option in settings. 

## Start Github Classroom

Visit this URL:

Classroom ---- **<https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/182560395-spring-2025>**

You'll be presented with a window like this:

![](lab8media/media/classroominit.png)

Select your email from the list below, and continue, making sure to accept any of the authorizations that are present and to
Accept the assignment. 

![](lab8media/media/classroomaccept.png)

This is going to have you enter the comp55
organization. If you have already signed up for an account it may ask
you to re-enter your credentials. Once accepted you'll be greeted with this image asking you to refresh.

![](lab8media/media/gitprepminilab.png)

Wait a minute or two, and then follow the lead given by github, refresh the page, then click on the repo name, which will have your own github handle on it as part of the link.  That will take you to the github site where you will see your repository, with your handle at the end of the repository name.  Click on the green code button ![](lab8media/media/greencode.png) and then the copy button ![](lab8media/media/image8.png) to copy the URL, as shown here:    

![](lab8media/media/gitacceptcopy.gif)

Make sure to save this URL that was just created specifically for you.
You will need it in the next step, so please also just keep this page open.  Otherwise if you close it', you'll need to navigate back through it by going to classroom.github.com and logging yourself in.

## Importing your new Github Repository into eclipse

Now once eclipse is open, go ahead and do a *File->Import->Git->Projects from Git with Smart Import*.  On the next screen choose the Clone URI button as shown in the image below.

![](lab8media/media/importrepo.gif)

Enter in your own GitHub URL that you created by going to this site.  (Eclipse may have also automagically filled it in for you.  If you still have it, you can [click here](##saving-your-github-credentials) to jump to next part, otherwise, you can keep reading.

### Help! I lost my github URL!

If you have lost the repository URL, go back to github.com. When you get there, or
if you log back in you just need to access your repositories, which will
be listed on the right once you login. Clicking on the repository will land you at a page similar to what was shown above.

## Saving your Github Credentials
if your git password is not accepted in next step, try this approach "Got to Git settings -> developer settings -> personal access tocken -> create new tocken -> give it a name, set expiration to no expiration and select all options and then create your tocken. this can be used as your password."
Because you'll be need to enter your credentials often, it may make sense to just store them in the secure store, which means that the credentials are stored on your computer.  If you are super worried about safety, please just store them there and use a throwaway account for this class.  I've had to deal with many more students forgetting their github passwords and locking themselves over their accounts, than having students whose computers have been hacked and whose github credentials have been rickrolled.  So please check the option **Store in Secure Store** so that
way your password is saved. As part of this, eclipse may ask you for some
recovery questions, which you can provide if you want, but nonetheless *save your password in the secure store*, the only scenario where I can see this being an issue if you are sharing an eclipse program with another developer who has a different login, and that should be quite scarce. s

![](lab8media/media/image9.png)

Just click next a bunch of times to verify that all the settings look correct, like this image shows below.

![](lab8media/media/importfromgit.gif)

When you click Finish, you'll see that your project is now in the package explorer and will look something like this.

![](lab8media/media/nameofproject.png)

Notice that there is this text in brackets ![](lab8media/media/brackets5.png) that is to the right of the name of our project.  That information is showing us the repository name as well as the name of our branch, which is called main.  For this class we will not discuss much about branching, so we will work exclusively on the **main** branch.

## Opening your project

Go ahead and open up the project *COMP55GitPrepLab* and double click on
*SimplePicture.java* . You'll see that it will behave like if you
imported the project. You can also run it if you like by running simple
picture. At this point the project should work and run. If it doesn't,
you may have to change some preferences on your eclipse, but this is
very rare.

## Examining ```user.name``` and ```user.email``` to your Git Preferences

So that we can make sure that you get credit for committing and working
on the project, we're going to have you make one additional change to
your Eclipse settings, **which you will need to do if you work on any other
computers so that you get credit for all of your work**. In order
to do this, we'll go into eclipse and click on *Window-\>Preferences*
(If you are on a mac, this would be in *Eclipse-\>Preferences*.

Once there, you'll see this window, which I'll ask you to navigate to the git configuration by typing **git** in the search box and then clicking *Configuration*.  
**Look to see if you have user.name and user.email**

![](lab8media/media/eclipseprefs.gif)

**You need to verify that you have those two fields with each computer that you use.** 
Change your name attribute to your actual name.  If you don't have user.name then skip to the next paragraph.
If you have the entries for user.email and user.name in the bottom but with your email and your actual name, then you can click **Apply and Close** to exit preferences and [jump to the next section](##committing-and-pushing-changes).  

### Adding user.name and user.email if you don't have them.
You'll be adding your email (the one you used in github)
and name to your settings for all computers. On the same git configuration screen, click the *Add Entry* button on
the upper right. For the *key* type **user.email** and for *value*, you
want to put the email that you registered with or used to signup for a
github account. The user.name can just be your first name if you want.
Once done, then you can click ***Apply and Close***.
*You need to do this with every computer that you have so that you can
get credit for your submissions.* Make sure to use the same name and
email for all your computers\!

## Committing and pushing changes

For this mini-lab, we're only interested in getting you used to the
mechanics of making a simple change and uploading that change to github.
So here's what I'm going to ask you to do.

Change line 16 in *SimplePicture.java* so that the text says ```"How I
felt before knowing about github"```, and change the ```y``` position for the
Glabel to be ```300```.

Once you do this, you'll notice that your project will now have a
greater than sign (```>```) in the package explorer, which will look
something like this:

![](lab8media/media/changesmade.png)Those signs that you see to the left of
the project are letting you know that git believes that these files have
changed. When files have changed, git wants to give them a new version
number. To give or to save these files so that git can reference them in
the future, you'll want to do what's called **commit**. To commit the
files, simply right click on the project, near the bottom of the menu, select *Team-\>Commit*.
That may open up a **Git Staging View**, which will look something like
this

![](lab8media/media/gitstaging.png)

If you look, **staged** changes are files that git has identified as
needing to be updated once you click the commit button, while
**unstaged** changes are files that git has identified as being
different than what's on the server, but will not be updated after
clicking commit. *You need to be careful of what you decide to put in
staged changes versus unstaged changes.* When you try to commit, git
looks at all files in your current directory to see what is new or what
has changed. Anything it doesn't know what to do will be put in the
unstaged changes area.

In the picture above, the right area is the commit message, where you'll
want to write a short message that outlines what changes you made, in
this case you can simply put something like, ```Changed the text to
reflect final assignment```. *Make sure the author/committer has the name
and email that you stored in your preferences settings*. Finally near
the bottom right of the image you'll find two buttons: ***Commit and
Push*** and ***Commit***. In this situation, I'm going to ask you to
simply click **Commit and Push**, which not only saves a new version of
your project (**commit**), but also sends your changes over to
github.com (**push**). Sometimes you may just want to commit without
sending all the changes to the server yet. We'll talk about that in the
git lab in the future. For now just click ***Commit and Push***. After
clicking, you'll get a dialog box where you can click Close.

![](lab8media/media/pushdone.png)

## Verify your activity on GitHub

Once you completed the steps and push, verify that you have in fact finished by visiting **github.com** and clicking on your repository.  Once there, follow the gif below:

![](lab8media/media/githubprepcheck.gif)

Like the image, you should see your changes. If github.com
has the change you pushed that's part of the credit. The other part of
the credit will come from the settings. In github.com you can go to your
repository and click on the **commits**, where you'll see a list of the changes that you've made to
the project. You should see a commit that has your picture and name on
it at the top.

Like the gif above click on the text has your commit message and you'll see the
changes that you committed and how your commit changed the file, which
you can immediately identify. If you see your custom picture and your
name or id, then you'll get the rest of the credit. If you don't, then
simply make an additional change to one of the files (adding a line or a
space) while [editing the user preferences as outlined earlier](##editing-your-git-preferences).
There's no need to upload anything to canvas as all your changes will be
stored on github. Hooray\!

That's it for now\! We'll do more with git in the future, but this is
just meant to get you ready for when we start coding.
