# Git Team Lab 
## Points given based on completing all steps with team

While this is a team lab, each of you will need to do this on your own
computer. Your points for this lab will be based off of both your own
and your team's ability to finish this lab, so it's important to work
together. **Make sure that you can see what
everyone else is doing, so that you can provide each other help.** It's
also important that all of you finished the [Git Prep Mini-Lab](8-Github-Prep.html), which was
necessary to finish before starting here. You should also be part of
this class's github organization, if you didn't accept the invite, let
me know and I can send you another one.

## Step 0: Everyone - Pick roles and setup room

Setup your computers so you can all see each other's screens, and
decide on labelling the people on your team: Each one of you will take on one of these four roles:

1. git team admin (team member without computer issues)
2. hackslash
3. procrastinator 
4. martyr (git team admin will take on this role for 3 person teams)

In addition to feeling comfortable with computers, your git team admin should also feel comfortable
searching for things in google. Once you decide on an admin notify me.

## Step 1: Team Admins - setup repo
## Everyone else â€“ Observe the process
Assignment Link - "https://classroom.github.com/a/0SAzb53e"

Team Admins, go to the above link. There you'll
accept the assignment, and it will ask you to create a team. Make a team with your team's name. Once you [continue](lab9media/media/acceptteam.gif), you'll eventually be asked to wait a little bit while github creates the repository.  [After refreshing the page](lab9media/media/repomade.gif) you'll get the default files that I have provided for all of
you for this lab. The next thing will be to let everyone know that they
can now signup.  

## Step 2: Everyone - Clone the new project

Once your team admin has notified you that the team has been created,
visit **https://classroom.github.com/a/0SAzb53e**. Make sure that you **choose your
correct group**. Once you've chosen the group and accepted the group
assignment, you'll then be led to your new repository. At this point
you'll want to **clone** your team's new project.

To checkout the project, you'll need the URL from github, so once you
are on the project page via github's site, remember that you can copy the URL using the copy button ![](lab8media/media/image8.png) next to the URL that is revealed after clicking on the ![](lab8media/media/greencode.png) button on your group repo page.  

With that URL in your clipboard, you should use the [same guidelines from our previous lab](8-Github-Prep.html##importing-your-new-repository-in-eclipse) that
we posted previously about cloning a git repository via eclipse, so go
into eclipse, open up the git perspective and clone a repository.

If you've forgotten the steps here, it's best if you go back and refer to the images about [importing into eclipse](lab8media/media/importrepo.gif) and [following the import wizard](lab8media/media/importfromgit.gif). 

*Before moving to
step 3 make sure everyone on your team has the group project and that it
looks the same on everyone's computers*, which means it should look something like this: ![](lab9media/media/step2check.png).  There should be nothing to the left of the folder.

## Step 3: Everyone - make a change and reset (undo)

This may seem silly, but mistakes happen.  Changes also become more difficult when you have accidentally made changes and you want to receive the latest version of the project.  For many of you, this will be
the first time where you will be working with other people to write
code, which is exciting, but can also lead to some trouble. 

What I'd like you to do is simply add one line to the 
java file in this project and **save the file**. It can be changing a color, adding a comment or anything else you'd like to do that will only take a minute.  The change is not important, what's important is getting used to
using git with a team before you start working on a much more
complicated project.

Once all of you have made the changes and saved the file, you'll notice that
your project, along with the file that they modified, now have a
greater than sign (```>```) next to all projects and directories that
contain changes that differ from the latest **commit**, which is a named revision of your code.  Study this image here and what happens after saving.

![](lab9media/media/singlechange.gif)

More specifically look at what happened to the file after saving, which is that you have the sign next to all the changes.  

![](lab9media/media/image3.png)

If you ever want to see what's different you can right click on the file
and select *compare to-\>HEAD revision*. 

![](lab9media/media/comparewith.png)

Anytime you see a greater than
sign, it means that if you have something that is different than the
latest version, and you have two choices to make: commit or **reset a
directory**, which would revert your changes back to what the latest
version is, thereby *losing the changes you've made since your last commit*. Let's all do this
right now. To do this, right click on the project, and say
*Team-\>Reset*. And follow this example here.

![](lab9media/media/teamreset.gif)

Selecting the **Hard option** at the
bottom will do a *Hard reset*, which will replace your current files with
the previous files that were committed. Notice that after clicking the **Reset** Button, 
you'll see that the changes you just made will go away and the **\>**
symbol will be gone from the project, which lets you know that you are
back to how the project was initially. Doing a reset is useful in
situations where you don't remember what changes you made and you are
getting into situations where you are getting errors and don't feel like
you've done much with the code. Once all your team members make a change
and reset so that they *no longer have a \> sign on their project*, you
can move on to step 4.

## Step 4: Martyr commits, and Hackslash pulls afterwards

Let's have the Martyr make a commit - **if you don't remember your roles please review them now.**

Remember how in grade school sometimes when discussions were unruly you had a *talking stick* where the
person holding the stick was the only one able to talk? For this lab we're going to
mimic this behavior, where I want your team to take turns
with the *programming stick*.  While one person is holding the programming stick
they will be the only ones making changes to code, everyone else should
just watch them. Now this isn't realistic, but this is just meant to
again get us used to the workflow of how to leverage this software
while working on a group project. ***Let's have the martyr 
refactor the String filename for our GImage as a constant (~Line 14).***  Save, and next, **commit and push** the change. One note on
committing. When committing in the git staging view you end up seeing
two areas, ***Staged Changes*** and ***Unstaged Changes***. Files that have been
saved after being modified will show up in one of these two areas.
![](lab9media/media/image5.png)

**Staged Changes** means that these are changes that are going to be
submitted as part of that commit, while **Unstaged Changes** are changes
that may have been made but that you don't want the repository to
record. Any files that you could potentially add to the directory will
show up as unstaged changes. A commit needs at least one staged change,
but you do not always want to move everything from unstaged to staged.
For example, let's say you were testing out some code and added a
picture of yourself to the project so that you could use it. You may not
necessarily want that picture to be added into git and stored on github
as once you add it to the repository, it's a bit more difficult to get
it out. Another thing could be certain development preferences that you
have like having a certain text coloring theme. Git may not know much about your project, it merely checks your git repository for new files or files that
have changed and asks if you want to commit
them. If you don't want git to track certain files, you can ask git to
**ignore** those files. On the other hand, your java files should
typically be in staged changes everytime you commit though, as you want
git to keep track of those changes in each commit. Remember that when
you commit, you will have to enter a **commit message** which summarizes what was done. Once the
martyr commits and pushes, if it was successful they'll get a message
like this.

![](lab9media/media/image6.png)

It's important to look at the upper window, since if it fails it's going
to give you a message that just says something like *rejected, non
fast-forward* in the area highlighted. We'll get into this more in a
later step. Everything else will just have information on the date of
the commit, when it was, and what repository it was for. Once you're
finished clicking the message, you can click OK.

Once the martyr pushes, the hackslash person, who does not have the \>
signs on their project, should pull the project from eclipse (which they
can do by right-clicking on the project and saying *Team-\>Pull*,
selecting the Pull option that does not have the three dots next to it).
If hackslash does have the \> sign on their project, have them do a hard
reset like we did in step 2 before pulling.

## Step 5: Everyone - Look at the results in the History

Open up the history view to view the changes

Everyone can open up the **History view** which can be done by right
clicking on the project and selecting *Team-\>Show In History*. This
will bring up the history of commits, along with the authors and the
little messages detailing what happened.  If you click on the history and
file that is present, scrolling through the lower left window will show you
the changes made.

![](lab9media/media/egithistory.gif)

The history will show you the list of all the changes that were made for
a particular project and when they were committed, along with an ID that
you can just think of as being a version number. Notice how in the picture above clicking on the different files will highlight the additions
and deletions that were made to that file as part of that commit. Git
will keep track for you line by line of each change on each file that
was made as part of that commit.

When you do a history view, also notice that **the martyr has the same history as the hackslash, but different than the procrastinator and the git team admin.** You can verify with your team members that
their history has a different commit ID at the top, depending on
whether they pulled or committed or did nothing. That is because *git
uses your local copy of the repository to bring up the history.* It does
not give you the latest version unless you ask it to fetch the latest
version or pull.

## Step 6: Hackslash - commit multiple times and then push

Let's have the hackslash, who just pulled in the previous step, now add
a comment at the top of the java file, **but not push.** After
committing, let's have the hackslash add an additional comment to the
beginning of java file and commit again without pushing. If the
hackslash did push that's ok, just start the process over. What the
hackslash should have is a series of two commits that have not been
pushed onto the server, where the changes are only in the comments at
the top (lines 1 & 2). Hackslash should also not edit any other lines\! Once the
hackslash has this, they should open up their history view to verify
that they have two commits that their teammates don't have. The other
option would be to have the hackslash just check in the package explorer
where their project is:

![](lab9media/media/image8far.png)

Notice how at the end of ![](lab9media/media/image8.png) you see ![](lab9media/media/2commits.png), the up arrow means commits need to be sent to the server and the number 2 denotes how many changes need to be sent (in this case, 2 commits).


Once the hackslash has the two commits, they can then right click on
their project and say *Team-\>Push to origin*. Pushing to origin
takes those local commits that they have on their computer and sends
them over to the github server, making them visible to everyone.
Hackslash, make sure you get a message that does not say it was
rejected, but rather, that you got a successful push, which means your screen should look similar to this and the ![](lab9media/media/2commits.png) you had in your repo should disappear.

![](lab9media/media/pushtoorigin.gif)

About committingâ€¦You should think of committing as being like a
meta-save. Generally you want to commit every time you add some new
feature into your code that works. If you get something to work or there
is new functionality then you should commit to describe what it is that
you added. **For the purposes of this class I'm going to ask you to
commit very often.** Committing code is going to be an important factor
in your grade. While you shouldn't commit after doing every line like
I'm going to ask you to do here, I would say once you've added
something that makes the program different than what you had before (say
a difference or change of 10 or 20 lines of code just to give a rough
estimate) it would make sense to commit. It makes sense that when you
have something that can be described in a short message as being
different than what you had before, you should commit it. Then after
having several commits, once you have something that you feel is working
well enough that it won't break other people's code and is bug free and
that they should now have, that is when you should push the code to
github.

With the hacklash successfully pushing, have the martyr pull the latest results, and
verify that they both have the same history. Notice that when the martyr
pulled, their version of the code was replaced with the newest version.
This is what generally happens when you **pull**, it will not only fetch the
information from the server, but also change your code so that you have
the latest changes in your project's files. *So far the hackslash and
martyr should have the latest changes, and the others should not.* This
is important before moving on, if not you can just repeat this step to
make additional changes to the code. No need to revert back.

## Step 7: Procrastinator - Commit and Unsucessfully Push

Let's have the procrastinator push changes

Now it's the procastinator's turn. ***Procrastinator, make a change to the
the text of the
GLabel (~Line 18) to whatever you want.*** Then **save** the file, commit
(*Team-\>Commit*) and try to push the changes they just made to that
file. *While the commit will have been successful, the push will not.*
Eclipse very subtly tell you the push was unsuccessful, by showing
you this:

![](lab9media/media/image10.png)

Why was it rejected? Let's have a quick drawing to see what's going on
here.

![](lab9media/media/trees.gif)

In this drawing, think of the two sides here as being a
simplified view of the two competing histories. On the one hand the left
side represents the history of commits that the server has, as well as
martyr & hackslash. For example, first everyone was on the original
version. Then martyr ended up making a commit based off of that original commit.
The martyr pushed their changes.  Next the hackslash, who pulled the code received the latest commit, so their commits were based off of martyr's changes. Meanwhile, the procrastinator, who never pulled,
committed a change based on the original commit. When the procrastinator
tried to push their changes. The server noticed that their newest change
was based on the original, but that they did not have the latest
changes, and therefore rejected the change, saying it couldn't update
the server since they don't have the latest information. One way to view this is when both sides have a different version of their history each with their own original copy.  A more accurate
representation of this graph, which is transformed based off of what happens in the image, reveals that the procrastinator and the martyr commits are both based
off of the original commit. Because the procrastinator's build is not
based off of the latest version, it won't allow it to say that it is in
fact the latest version. This is completely reasonable behavior, and so
you should not worry as much about getting into this situation but
rather just know how to get out. To resolve this, what the procrastinator is going to
have to do is to pull the code, **[ensuring they don't have a \> symbol before pulling.]** (*Right click-\>Team-\>Pull)*. Because
they have already committed, git will do its darndest to do the right
thing and merge the procrastinator's changes with the hack's changes and
create a new version based on the changes. That new change or the merge
would theoretically look like the following graph below.

![](lab9media/media/treemerge.png)

As you can see what git is doing is
basing the new commit off of the two changes, what was on the server and
the changes that the procrastinator did. As mentioned previously when
you pull, git will automatically try to create a merged version. Based
off of the merge it might be able to merge the two commits completely by
itself, or it may need your help. When the changes are done on
completely different files, git does not have much trouble merging,
since it will just use the latest version of the file from each commit.
If the changes are on the same file, if git has an idea of where those
lines are git will also do its best to keep the changes from each
version, as you can see from this pull. However, if it needs more
information from you to make the decision, you will enter into what's
considered a merge mode since it needs to know what version is the
latest based on your decisions. In this case, since the procrastinator
pulled if they were to get conflicts then they would be the ones making
the decision as to which lines of the file are the most current. We will
get ourselves into that mess in the next step, as it's important for all
of you to be aware of and to at least try it. If you did you yourself
into that mess already, congratulations\! You can move on to the next
step, just read this part here until you get the picture that has the
**Conflicting** result. If git knew how to merge the two files, then
the procrastinator will get a success message to pop up, where the result will say
**Merged**, like this:

![](lab9media/media/mergeresult.png)

In this case, the Procrastinator, after clicking OK, will now have the
representation on their own machine like the graph that I placed up at
the top, they can confirm this by showing the history of the git commits
in their history, (they can get here by right clicking on the project,
and then going to *Team-\>Show Repository in History View*.)

![](lab9media/media/pbeforepush.png)

In this view, notice the ![](lab9media/media/originmain.png) label.  It is attached to the commit that is the latest one that github has for the main branch.  That tag is different, but shows how your main version is based off of the origin main and that the hackslash 2 commit that was made is the one that the server thinks is currently the most recent.  This is also where the ![](lab9media/media/2commits.png) comes into play, as it is saying
that the version of the git history that the procrastinator has, contains two commits that need to be pushed to the server (the difference between ![](lab9media/media/originmain.png) and ![](lab9media/media/main.png)). 

![](lab9media/media/image8far.png)

To do this, one simply
right clicks on the project and says *Team-\>Push To Origin*. Once
they do that they should verify it was a success by looking at the
results. The procrastinator will
see that the origin main tag is now at the top, indicating github has the version that they have as the latest on their computer.   

Now the rest of the team can pull the latest changes, **making sure they
don't have any greater than signs on their projects**. Once they pull they
should also look at the history view and notice their history matches the procrastinators, with all of them looking now something like this:

![](lab9media/media/pafterpush.png)

If you notice the left, it shows a similar diverging graph that comes
back together with the merge at the end.

Here's a [full walkthrough](lab9media/media/resolvemerge.gif) for the procrastinator on solving the merge steps, which just consists of pulling and then pushing, when a push is rejected.

## Step 8: Martyr & Hackslash - commit and push the same line

Let's cause some havoc :fire:

So at this point you either had success getting git to merge something
for you or git failed at being able to merge things for you. If git was
successful in merging, let's have you get into a situation where git
can't figure out what the latest version or the best lines to have in
the file are. To do this we're going to set it up so that the martyr and
the hackslash try to modify the same line in the same file. **After having pulled, have both
hackslash and the martyr change the GLabel's text.** The easiest thing to
do in this case is to change the text by adding in your name as part of
the label. You can use your own real name or you can use the name I've
assigned you. Then go ahead and commit. *Let's have hackslash push their
commit to the server and then try to have the martyr push theirs.* The
martyr will notice that they will be rejected from pushing their
changes. When they pull to get the latest changes from the server,
they'll notice that the result will be slightly different, where
they'll get a conflicting results instead of merging.

![](lab9media/media/image17.png)

Now, this is going to look a little bit scarier as well, since your
project explorer will have some red icons that are next to it.

![](lab9media/media/image18.png)

Also take a look at the status message in the package explorer - 
![](lab9media/media/conflictstatus.png).  Here notice that it is telling you you are in the conflicting state, with one change yet to be pushed to the server, while you also need to incorporate one change from the server.  

If you also notice the git staging view has also changed to give you some type of indication that something is wrong.  
![](lab9media/media/gitstagingconflict.png)

These are the numerous ways that eclipse is letting you know that
you have conflicts or changes that it doesn't know how to resolve.
Since it can't automatically merge them like before, **it is the task of whoever gets the merge conflict to carefully solve the issues**. In this case, if you followed the instructions, it will be the martyr's job.  Open TeamPicture.java. Once opened, notice the scary red, but don't worry about it\! Git has replaced your java
file with a text version of the one it needs help resolving, the java
file when opened up will look something like this:

![](lab9media/media/image19.png)

The important parts to look at are lines 18-22. Line 19 shows the
version that you made, while line 21 shows the version that was on the
server. When it doesn't know which change is right, git will use this
notation:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
    your changes
=======
    changes on server
>>>>>>> branch 'main' of https://url-for-your-git-repos-here
``` 

This notation lets you know
you need to make a decision for all places where it notices a conflict on what she be used.  If you get into a conflicting state, it's your job
to decide what code to keep (yours, the servers or some mix of the two). Once you decide what lines are the
right ones, you will go ahead and delete the rest of the markings so
that the errors go away and it looks like a java file. In this case,
let's have the martyr use hackslash's line 21 instead. This means that
after editing and saving the file, it should look something like this.

![](lab9media/media/image20.png)

(The gray x's to the left of the line
numbers are only there if you haven't saved the file yet) While the
syntax errors went away, you'll notice that the repo still says that it is in conflicting mode.  Notice the red icons in the project
explorer for martyr have not disappeared, and all the previous places that mentioned conflict are still there. To get rid of the red marks, the martyr
should drag the file from unstaged to staged changes, in the git staging view. (Alternatively, they could also right click on the file and choose *Team-\>Add To Index* after saving)  The icons
will update to indicate that the file will be added to the repository ![](lab9media/media/addicon.png): Once the icons have changed, the **martyr will commit and push the changes** to update the
server. So click the button like this picture is showing here to get rid of being in the merge state.  Make sure to push, as you may not be able to pull additional code until the conflict and merge have been resolved.  Once they have been pushed, the arrows and merged status will go away.

![](lab9media/media/resolvedconflict.png)

**If you ever get to a conflict and aren't sure what to keep, ask your team members.** If your team members do ever commit changes that later disappear,
those changes will be tracked and viewable so that you
can get them and change your code back if needed.  (You can always feel free to ask me if you run into that type of issue as well.  But the safest thing is always to save and commit your code.)  Note that in certain situations after committing you may have to resolve multiple conflicts.  This happens when you haven't touched or been active in working with the code in a long time.  

## Step 9: Everyone - Successfully resolve a merge conflict

Wreak :fire: More :fire: Havoc :fire:

This part about resolving conflicts is so integral that I now want you
to as a team to all try to make a change on the same line and go through
the process of each of you resolving the changes being in that conflict
mode and having to re-add the file and commit and push. Part of your
credit from this lab will be me looking at your git history and seeing
that all of you have tried this, so make sure to help each other along
the way. Since the martyr tried making the change the last time, have
them push first so that they don't have to do the process again. Also
make sure that no one tries to pull after each push, assume they don't
know the changes have been pushed. So that the last person will be
possibly many commits behind everyone else.

## Step 10: Everyone - Be aware of a conflict problems


While this is the end of the official lab, I want you to be aware of one
more issue that seems to pop up a lot when folks are using git, which is
a git conflict problems. This tends to happen when you have uncommitted
changes, and then you decide to try to pull in the latest changes. Git
has issues with this because pulling replaces your code and files with
the latest versions. However, if you have work that you saved, but did
not commit, it would be throwing this code potentially away. This is not
the case when you commit, since those changes are stored on the database
if you ever need to go back to them, which you can view in the history.
**If you do have **\>** signs on the project explorer and decide to pull
in changes from the server** (and the server has changes to give you)
you'll raise these scary messages one on top of the other.

![](lab9media/media/conflictproblem.png)
![](lab9media/media/pullcanceled.png)

If you do get that error, you have a few options, you can either commit
your latest changes, or if you feel like you didn't really make any
changes and they must be by accident or say you were just playing around
with the code, then it would be best for you to do a hard reset like we
did in Step 2. Once you either commit or reset the code, you can then
try to pull the code again. Remember that if you did commit after
pulling and merging it's best for you to push the code back on the
server so that you let the server know that you have the latest changes.

If you ever want to find out if changes have been made but aren't ready to replace your code with those changes (but just want to see how many changes have been made or how many changes you need to incorporate, you can instead right click on the project and select *Team-\>Fetch from Origin*).  Then just like you saw before in the package explorer, you'll be able to see the number of commits that are you behind from your server, with a down arrow to show them.  

## Step 11: Everyone - Practice pushing and pulling!

Practice the workflow\!

Based on the lab, I think it's important to remember how to work on the
project. Before you start working on the project, make sure to pull to
get the latest changes. The easiest way to know you are up to date is by
making sure you have no arrows in the project explorer and that when you
pull it tells you everything is up to date. Then you go ahead and
commit, commit, and commit again. Once you are finally ready then push
your changes. If that push fails, you'll need to do a pull to merge with
your team members changes. Once you merge and commit, you should then
push your changes. There are more advanced ways of using git, but this
is the way that I'm going to be looking for you to use git in this
class, as simply getting used to source control when working on projects
is a big undertaking. For the rest of this lab you guys should just get
into the habit of trying to quickly modify the file that you have and
making changes to it together. Each of you should try to have as many
changes made to this lab project as possible and points will be given
based on the smallest number of commits and merges done by the team
member with the smallest amount of activity before the due date. Also
for this class I want all of you to only use the single ```main``` branch.

### More Git Theory (Optional)

![](lab9media/media/Egit-lifecycle.png)

Here is a helpful illustration from the [Eclipse Foundation](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Recording_Changes_in_the_Repository)

The above illustration can be read like this:

* When you **add a file**, you are telling Git to keep **track** of it. 
* Once you **modify** the file, git recognizes that the file is different, but does 
not immediately submit those as official changes to the repo.  To put them up for 
consideration, you **stage** the changes.  A good metaphor for this is that you are 
preparing to save these changes as a draft.
* Once you stage the changes, you can then **commit** those changes, which keeps them 
in git's history. This is like you actually saving the draft (as a copy).  Committing 
is good in that it allows you to keep track of what you've done.
* The cycle then moves you back to having all the files be up to date, so the cycle 
repeats. 

For more information regarding the illustration and using Git with Eclipse, check out the [EGit/User Guide](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Getting_Started).


Also if any of this confuses you, you may start searching google for
more resources to learn git. There is some good stuff out there (and
also lots of bad stuff), however, most of it revolves around using the
command line, so it's probably better to ask me or your TA if you need
help or have any questions.

Let me know what still confuses you so I can make this lab better in the
future\!
